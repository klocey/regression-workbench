   .. rubric:: Assay of serum free light chain for 7874 subjects.
      :name: flchain

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   This is a stratified random sample containing 1/2 of the subjects
   from a study of the relationship between serum free light chain (FLC)
   and mortality. The original sample contains samples on approximately
   2/3 of the residents of Olmsted County aged 50 or greater.

      data(flchain, package=""survival"")

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   A data frame with 7874 persons containing the following variables.

   ``age``
      age in years

   ``sex``
      F=female, M=male

   ``sample.yr``
      the calendar year in which a blood sample was obtained

   ``kappa``
      serum free light chain, kappa portion

   ``lambda``
      serum free light chain, lambda portion

   ``flc.grp``

   ``creatinine``
      serum creatinine

   ``mgus``
      1 if the subject had been diagnosed with monoclonal gammapothy
      (MGUS)

   ``futime``
      days from enrollment until death. Note that there are 3 subjects
      whose sample was obtained on their death date.

   ``death``
      0=alive at last contact date, 1=dead

   ``chapter``
      for those who died, a grouping of their primary cause of death by
      chapter headings of the International Code of Diseases ICD-9

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   In 1995 Dr. Robert Kyle embarked on a study to determine the
   prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
   (MGUS) in Olmsted County, Minnesota, a condition which is normally
   only found by chance from a test (serum electrophoresis) which is
   ordered for other causes. Later work suggested that one component of
   immunoglobulin production, the serum free light chain, might be a
   possible marker for immune disregulation. In 2010 Dr. Angela
   Dispenzieri and colleagues assayed FLC levels on those samples from
   the original study for which they had patient permission and from
   which sufficient material remained for further testing. They found
   that elevated FLC levels were indeed associated with higher death
   rates.

   Patients were recruited when they came to the clinic for other
   appointments, with a final random sample of those who had not yet had
   a visit since the study began. An interesting side question is
   whether there are differences between early, mid, and late recruits.

   This data set contains an age and sex stratified random sample that
   includes 7874 of the original 15759 subjects. The original subject
   identifiers and dates have been removed to protect patient identity.
   Subsampling was done to further protect this information.

   This data set contains survival times for two competing causes: time
   from prostate cancer diagnosis to death from prostate cancer, and
   time from prostate cancer diagnosis to death from other causes. The
   data set also contains information on several risk factors. The data
   in this data set are simulated from detailed competing risk survival
   curves and counts of numbers of patients per group presented in
   Lu-Yao et al. (2009). Thus, the simulated data presented here contain
   many of the characteristics of the original SEER-Medicare prostate
   cancer data used in Lu-Yao et al. (2009).

      :name: aids

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   The ``aids`` data frame has 570 rows and 6 columns.

   Although all cases of AIDS in England and Wales must be reported to
   the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre, there is often a
   considerable delay between the time of diagnosis and the time that it
   is reported. In estimating the prevalence of AIDS, account must be
   taken of the unknown number of cases which have been diagnosed but
   not reported. The data set here records the reported cases of AIDS
   diagnosed from July 1983 and until the end of 1992. The data are
   cross-classified by the date of diagnosis and the time delay in the
   reporting of the cases.

   .. rubric:: Usage

   This data frame contains the following columns:

   ``year``
      The year of the diagnosis.

   ``quarter``
      The quarter of the year in which diagnosis was made.

   ``delay``
      The time delay (in months) between diagnosis and reporting. 0
      means that the case was reported within one month. Longer delays
      are grouped in 3 month intervals and the value of ``delay`` is the
      midpoint of the interval (therefore a value of ``2`` indicates
      that reporting was delayed for between 1 and 3 months).

   ``dud``
      An indicator of censoring. These are categories for which full
      information is not yet available and the number recorded is a
      lower bound only.

   ``time``
      The time interval of the diagnosis. That is the number of quarters
      from July 1983 until the end of the quarter in which these cases
      were diagnosed.

   ``y``
      The number of AIDS cases reported.

   The ``cd4`` data frame has 20 rows and 2 columns.

   CD4 cells are carried in the blood as part of the human immune
   system. One of the effects of the HIV virus is that these cells die.
   The count of CD4 cells is used in determining the onset of full-blown
   AIDS in a patient. In this study of the effectiveness of a new
   anti-viral drug on HIV, 20 HIV-positive patients had their CD4 counts
   recorded and then were put on a course of treatment with this drug.
   After using the drug for one year, their CD4 counts were again
   recorded. The aim of the experiment was to show that patients taking
   the drug had increased CD4 counts which is not generally seen in
   HIV-positive patients.

   The ``downs.bc`` data frame has 30 rows and 3 columns.

   Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by an extra chromosome
   21 or a part of chromosome 21 being translocated to another
   chromosome. The incidence of Down's syndrome is highly dependent on
   the mother's age and rises sharply after age 30. In the 1960's a
   large scale study of the effect of maternal age on the incidence of
   Down's syndrome was conducted at the British Columbia Health
   Surveillance Registry. These are the data which was collected in that
   study.

   Mothers were classified by age. Most groups correspond to the age in
   years but the first group comprises all mothers with ages in the
   range 15-17 and the last is those with ages 46-49. No data for
   mothers over 50 or below 15 were collected.

   during the period 1962 to 1977. The surgery consisted of complete
   removal of the tumour together with about 2.5cm of the surrounding
   skin. Among the measurements taken were the thickness of the tumour
   and whether it was ulcerated or not. These are thought to be
   important prognostic variables in that patients with a thick and/or

   The ``nodal`` data frame has 53 rows and 7 columns.

   The treatment strategy for a patient diagnosed with cancer of the
   prostate depend highly on whether the cancer has spread to the
   surrounding lymph nodes. It is common to operate on the patient to
   get samples from the nodes which can then be analysed under a
   microscope but clearly it would be preferable if an accurate
   assessment of nodal involvement could be made without surgery.

   For a sample of 53 prostate cancer patients, a number of possible
   predictor variables were measured before surgery. The patients then
   had surgery to determine nodal involvement. It was required to see if
   nodal involvement could be accurately predicted from the predictor
   variables and which ones were most important.

   ``aged``
      The patients age dichotomized into less than 60 (``0``) and 60 or
      over ``1``.

   ``stage``
      A measurement of the size and position of the tumour observed by
      palpitation with the fingers via the rectum. A value of ``1``
      indicates a more serious case of the cancer.

   ``grade``
      Another indicator of the seriousness of the cancer, this one is
      determined by a pathology reading of a biopsy taken by needle
      before surgery. A value of ``1`` indicates a more serious case of
      the cancer.

   ``xray``
      A third measure of the seriousness of the cancer taken from an
      X-ray reading. A value of ``1`` indicates a more serious case of
      the cancer.

   ``acid``
      The level of acid phosphatase in the blood serum.

   The data consist of headache logs kept by 133 patients in a treatment
   program in which bio-feedback was used to attempt to reduce migraine
   frequency and severity. Patients entered the program at different
   times over a period of about 3 years. Patients were encouraged to
   begin their logs four weeks before the onset of treatment and to
   continue for one month afterwards, but only 55 patients have data
   preceding the onset of treatment.

   Important characteristics of a clinical chemistry assay are its limit
   of blank (LoB), and its limit of detection (LoD). The LoB,
   conceptually the highest reading likely to be obtained from a
   zero-concentration sample, is defined operationally by the upper 95%
   point of readings obtained from samples that do not contain the
   analyte. The LoD, conceptually the lowest level of analyte that can
   be reliably determined not to be blank, is defined operationally as
   true value at which there is a 95% chance of the reading being above
   the LoB.

   These data are from a portion of a LoB/D study of an assay for a drug
   used to treat certain cancers. Twelve pools were used, four of them
   blanks of different types, and eight with successively increasing
   drug levels. The 8 columns of the data set refer to measurements made
   using different instruments I and reagent lots L.

   A dataset on Delta Variant Covid-19 cases in the UK. This dataset
   gives a great example of Simpson's Paradox. When aggregating results
   without regard to age group, the death rate for vaccinated
   individuals is higher – but they have a much higher risk population.
   Once we look at populations with more comparable risks (breakout age
   groups), we see that the vaccinated group tends to be lower risk in
   each risk-bucketed group and that many of the higher risk patients
   had gotten vaccinated. The dataset was brought to OpenIntro's
   attention by Matthew T. Brenneman of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
   University. Note: some totals in the original source differ as there
   were some cases that did not have ages associated with them.

   This is a toy data set derived from the General Social Survey that I
   intend to use for several purposes. First, the battery of abortion
   items can serve as toy data to illustrate mixed effects modeling as
   equivalent to a one-parameter (Rasch) model. Second, I include some
   covariates to also do some basic regressions. I think abortion
   opinions are useful learning tools for statistical inference for
   college students. Third, there's a time-series component as well for
   understanding how abortion attitudes have changed over time.

   only study which can give definitive evidence as to the causal
   effects of different health insurance plans. [...] Although the
   fieldwork of the study was conducted between 1974 and 1982, the
   results are still highly relevant, since RAND HIE is the only study
   which can make causal statements.' (Wikipedia, RAND Health Insurance

   The data are from the Muscatine Coronary Risk Factor (MCRF) study, a
   longitudinal survey of school-age children in Muscatine, Iowa. The
   MCRF study had the goal of examining the development and persistence
   of risk factors for coronary disease in children. In the MCRF study,
   weight and height measurements of five cohorts of children, initially
   aged 5-7, 7-9, 9-11, 11-13, and 13-15 years, were obtained biennially
   from 1977 to 1981. Data were collected on 4856 boys and girls. On the
   basis of a comparison of their weight to age-gender specific norms,
   children were classified as obese or not obese.

   ``wave``
      the survey wave

   ``year``
      the survey year corresponding to the survey wave

   ``aj``
      the justifiability of abortion on a 1-10 scale (1 = never
      justifiable; 10 = always justifiable)

   ``age``
      the age of the respondent in years

   ``collegeed``
      a dummy variable that equals 1 if the respondent graduated from
      college

   ``female``
      a dummy variable that equals 1 if the respondent is a woman

   ``unemployed``
      a dummy variable that equals 1 if the respondent is unemployed

   ``ideology``
      the ideological self-placement of the respondent on a 1-10 scale
      (1 = furthest to the left; 10 = furthest to the right)

   ``satisfinancial``
      the respondent's financial satisfaction with his/her life (1 =
      most dissatisfied; 10 = most satisfied)

   ``postma4``
      the post-materialist index for the respondent (-1 = materialist; 0

      (0)

   ``godimportant``
      the importance of God to the respondent on a 1-10 scale (1 = God
      is not at all important; 10 = God is most important)

   ``respectauthority``
      would more respect for authority be a welcome change to the United
      States?

   ``nationalpride``
      a dummy that equals 1 if the respondent is very proud to be an
      American.

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Data come from the World Values Survey. Note that the college
   education variable is curiously ``NA`` until the third survey wave.
   The child autonomy index ranges from -2 to 2 where increasing values
   indicate that children should learn determination and independence
   over obedience and religious faith. The ``respectauthority`` variable
   is coded where -1 means the respondent believes greater respect for
   authority in the United States as a future change to the country
   would be a bad thing. 0 means the respondent doesn't mind such a
   change. 1 = the respondent believes it would be a good thing.

   A subset of data from the World Health Organization Global
   Tuberculosis Report, and accompanying global populations. ``who``
   uses the original codes from the World Health Organization. The
   column names for columns 5 through 60 are made by combining ``new_``
   with:

   -  the method of diagnosis (``rel`` = relapse, ``sn`` = negative
      pulmonary smear, ``sp`` = positive pulmonary smear, ``ep`` =
      extrapulmonary),

   -  gender (``f`` = female, ``m`` = male), and

   -  age group (``014`` = 0-14 yrs of age, ``1524`` = 15-24, ``2534`` =
      25-34, ``3544`` = 35-44 years of age, ``4554`` = 45-54, ``5564`` =
      55-64, ``65`` = 65 years or older).

   ``who2`` is a lightly modified version that makes teaching the basics
   easier by tweaking the variables to be slightly more consistent and
   dropping ``iso2`` and ``iso3``. ``newrel`` is replaced by
   ``new_rel``, and a ``⁠_⁠`` is added after the gender.

      :name: who

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   A subset of data from the World Health Organization Global
   Tuberculosis Report, and accompanying global populations. ``who``
   uses the original codes from the World Health Organization. The
   column names for columns 5 through 60 are made by combining ``new_``
   with:

   -  the method of diagnosis (``rel`` = relapse, ``sn`` = negative
      pulmonary smear, ``sp`` = positive pulmonary smear, ``ep`` =
      extrapulmonary),

   -  gender (``f`` = female, ``m`` = male), and

   -  age group (``014`` = 0-14 yrs of age, ``1524`` = 15-24, ``2534`` =
      25-34, ``3544`` = 35-44 years of age, ``4554`` = 45-54, ``5564`` =
      55-64, ``65`` = 65 years or older).

   ``who2`` is a lightly modified version that makes teaching the basics
   easier by tweaking the variables to be slightly more consistent and
   dropping ``iso2`` and ``iso3``. ``newrel`` is replaced by
   ``new_rel``, and a ``⁠_⁠`` is added after the gender.

   On March 31, 2021, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that ""in a Phase 3
   trial in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age with or without prior
   evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19
   vaccine BNT162b2 demonstrated 100% efficacy and robust antibody
   responses, exceeding those recorded earlier in vaccinated
   participants aged 16 to 25 years old, and was well tolerated."" These
   results are from a Phase 3 trial in 2,260 adolescents 12 to 15 years
   of age in the United States. In the trial, 18 cases of COVID-19 were
   observed in the placebo group (n = 1,129) versus none in the
   vaccinated group (n = 1,131).

   Hill, LaPan, Li and Haney (2007) develop models to predict which
   cells in a high content screen were well segmented. The data consists
   of 119 imaging measurements on 2019. The original analysis used 1009
   for training and 1010 as a test set (see the column called ``case``).

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   The outcome class is contained in a factor variable called ``class``
   with levels ""PS"" for poorly segmented and ""WS"" for well segmented.

   The raw data used in the paper can be found at the Biomedcentral
   website. The version contained in ``cells`` is modified. First,
   several discrete versions of some of the predictors (with the suffix
   ""Status"") were removed. Second, there are several skewed predictors
   with minimum values of zero (that would benefit from some
   transformation, such as the log). A constant value of 1 was added to
   these fields: ``avg_inten_ch_2``, ``fiber_align_2_ch_3``,
   ``fiber_align_2_ch_4``, ``spot_fiber_count_ch_4`` and

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   Eligible subjects were adults, who spoke Spanish or English, reported
   alcohol, heroin or cocaine as their first or second drug of choice,
   resided in proximity to the primary care clinic to which they would
   be referred or were homeless. Patients with established primary care
   relationships they planned to continue, significant dementia,
   specific plans to leave the Boston area that would prevent research
   participation, failure to provide contact information for tracking
   purposes, or pregnancy were excluded.

   Subjects were interviewed at baseline during their detoxification
   stay and follow-up interviews were undertaken every 6 months for 2
   years. A variety of continuous, count, discrete, and survival time
   predictors and outcomes were collected at each of these five
   occasions.

   This dataset is a superset of the HELPmiss and HELPrct datasets which
   include far fewer variables. Full details of the survey instruments
   are available at the following link.

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   The Human Freedom Index is a report that attempts to summarize the
   idea of ""freedom"" through a bunch of different variables for many
   countries around the globe. It serves as a rough objective measure
   for the relationships between the different types of freedom -
   whether it's political, religious, economical or personal freedom -
   and other social and economic circumstances. The Human Freedom Index
   is an annually co-published report by the Cato Institute, the Fraser
   Institute, and the Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann
   Foundation for Freedom.

   .. rubric:: John Snow's Map and Data on the 1854 London Cholera
      Outbreak
      :name: Snow

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   The ``Snow`` data consists of the relevant 1854 London streets, the
   location of 578 deaths from cholera, and the position of 13 water
   pumps (wells) that can be used to re-create John Snow's map showing
   deaths from cholera in the area surrounding Broad Street, London in
   the 1854 outbreak. Another data frame provides boundaries of a
   tessellation of the map into Thiessen (Voronoi) regions which include
   all cholera deaths nearer to a given pump than to any other.

   The apocryphal story of the significance of Snow's map is that, by
   closing the Broad Street pump (by removing its handle), Dr. Snow
   stopped the epidemic, and demonstrated that cholera is a water borne
   disease. The method of contagion of cholera was not previously
   understood. Snow's map is the most famous and classical example in
   the field of medical cartography, even if it didn't happen exactly
   this way. (the apocryphal part is that the epidemic ended when the
   pump handle was removed.) At any rate, the map, together with various
   statistical annotations, is compelling because it points to the Broad
   Street pump as the source of the outbreak.

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   ``Snow.deaths``: A data frame with 578 observations on the following
   3 variables, giving the address of a person who died from cholera.
   When many points are associated with a single street address, they
   are ""stacked"" in a line away from the street so that they are more
   easily visualized. This is how they are displayed on John Snow's
   original map. The dates of the deaths are not individually recorded
   in this data set.

   ``case``
      Sequential case number, in some arbitrary, randomized order

   ``x``
      x coordinate

   ``y``
      y coordinate

   ``Snow.pumps``: A data frame with 13 observations on the following 4
   variables, giving the locations of water pumps within the boundaries
   of the map.

   ``pump``
      pump number

   ``label``
      pump label: ``Briddle St`` ``Broad St`` ... ``Warwick``

   ``x``
      x coordinate

   ``y``
      y coordinate

   ``Snow.streets``: A data frame with 1241 observations on the
   following 4 variables, giving coordinates used to draw the 528 street
   segment lines within the boundaries of the map. The map is created by
   drawing lines connecting the ``n`` points in each street segment.

   ``street``
      street segment number: ``1:528``

   ``n``
      number of points in this street line segment

   ``x``
      x coordinate

   ``y``
      y coordinate

   ``Snow.polygons``: A list of 13 data frames, giving the vertices of
   Thiessen (Voronoi) polygons containing each pump. Their boundaries
   define the area that is closest to each pump relative to all other
   pumps. They are mathematically defined by the perpendicular bisectors
   of the lines between all pumps. Each data frame contains:

   ``x``
      x coordinate

   ``y``
      y coordinate

   ``Snow.deaths2``: An alternative version of ``Snow.deaths``
   correcting some possible duplicate and missing cases, as described in
   ``vignette(""Snow_deaths-duplicates"")``.

   ``Snow.dates``: A data frame of 44 observations and 3 variables from
   Table 1 of Snow (1855), giving the number of fatal attacks and number
   of deaths by date from Aug. 19 – Sept. 30, 1854. There are a total of
   616 deaths represented in both columns ``attacks`` and ``deaths``; of
   these, the date of the attack is unknown for 45 cases.

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   The scale of the source map is approx. 1:2000. The ``(x, y)``
   coordinate units are 100 meters, with an arbitrary origin.

   Of the data in the ``Snow.dates`` table, Snow says, “The deaths in
   the above table are compiled from the sources mentioned above in
   describing the map; but some deaths which were omitted from the map
   on account of the number of the house not being known, are included
   in the table.”

   One limitation of these data sets is the lack of exact street
   addresses. Another is the lack of any data that would serve as a
   population denominator to allow for a comparison of mortality rates
   in the Broad Street pump area as opposed to others. See Koch (2000),
   Koch (2004), Koch & Denike (2009) and Tufte (1999), p. 27-37, for
   further discussion.

   .. rubric:: Tests of Auditory Perception in Children with OME
      :name: OME

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   Experiments were performed on children on their ability to
   differentiate a signal in broad-band noise. The noise was played from
   a pair of speakers and a signal was added to just one channel; the
   subject had to turn his/her head to the channel with the added
   signal. The signal was either coherent (the amplitude of the noise
   was increased for a period) or incoherent (independent noise was
   added for the same period to form the same increase in power).

   The threshold used in the original analysis was the stimulus loudness
   needs to get 75% correct responses. Some of the children had suffered
   from otitis media with effusion (OME).

      OME

   .. rubric:: Format
      :name: format

   The ``OME`` data frame has 1129 rows and 7 columns:

   ``ID``
      Subject ID (1 to 99, with some IDs missing). A few subjects were
      measured at different ages.

   ``OME``
      ``""low""`` or ``""high""`` or ``""N/A""`` (at ages other than 30 and 60
      months).

   ``Age``
      Age of the subject (months).

   ``Loud``
      Loudness of stimulus, in decibels.

   ``Noise``
      Whether the signal in the stimulus was ``""coherent""`` or
      ``""incoherent""``.

   ``Correct``
      Number of correct responses from ``Trials`` trials.

   ``Trials``
      Number of trials performed.

   .. rubric:: Background
      :name: background

   The experiment was to study otitis media with effusion (OME), a very
   common childhood condition where the middle ear space, which is
   normally air-filled, becomes congested by a fluid. There is a
   concomitant fluctuating, conductive hearing loss which can result in
   various language, cognitive and social deficits. The term ‘binaural
   hearing’ is used to describe the listening conditions in which the
   brain is processing information from both ears at the same time. The
   brain computes differences in the intensity and/or timing of signals
   arriving at each ear which contributes to sound localisation and also
   to our ability to hear in background noise.

   Some years ago, it was found that children of 7–8 years with a
   history of significant OME had significantly worse binaural hearing
   than children without such a history, despite having equivalent
   sensitivity. The question remained as to whether it was the timing,
   the duration, or the degree of severity of the otitis media episodes
   during critical periods, which affected later binaural hearing. In an
   attempt to begin to answer this question, 95 children were monitored
   for the presence of effusion every month since birth. On the basis of
   OME experience in their first two years, the test population was
   split into one group of high OME prevalence and one of low
   prevalence.

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   In 2004, the state of North Carolina released to the public a large
   data set containing information on births recorded in this state.
   This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are
   studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant
   mothers and the birth of their children. This is a random sample of
   1,000 cases from this data set.

   .. rubric:: Galton's data on the heights of parents and their
      children, by child
      :name: GaltonFamilies

   .. rubric:: Description
      :name: description

   This data set lists the individual observations for 934 children in
   205 families on which Galton (1886) based his cross-tabulation.

   In addition to the question of the relation between heights of
   parents and their offspring, for which this data is mainly famous,
   Galton had another purpose which the data in this form allows to
   address: Does marriage selection indicate a relationship between the
   heights of husbands and wives, a topic he called *assortative
   mating*? Keen [p. 297-298](2010) provides a brief discussion of this
   topic.

      family ID, a factor with levels ``001``-``204``

   ``father``
      height of father

   ``mother``
      height of mother

   ``midparentHeight``
      mid-parent height, calculated as ``(father + 1.08*mother)/2``

   ``children``
      number of children in this family

   ``childNum``
      number of this child within family. Children are listed in
      decreasing order of height for boys followed by girls

   ``gender``
      child gender, a factor with levels ``female`` ``male``

   ``childHeight``
      height of child

   Galton's notebook lists 963 children in 205 families ranging from
   1-15 adult children children. Of these, 29 had non-numeric heights
   recorded and are not included here.

   Families are largely listed in descending order of fathers and

      :name: background

   | Randomized Clinical Trial on the Effect of Treatment of Maternal
     Periodontal Disease Can Reduce Preterm Birth Risk.
   | Maternal periodontal disease has been linked in observational
     studies to preterm birth (< 37 weeks) and low birth weight (< 2500
     g) outcomes. The Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy study was a
     multi-center randomized trial evaluating the effect of nonsurgical
     periodontal treatment intervention on preterm birth, comparing
     outcomes of women treated before 21 weeks gestation (treatment) to
     those treated after delivery (control).
   | Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is
     a growing problem. In some cases, preterm birth can lead to infant
     death; in others, its consequences may include neurodevelopmental
     disabilities, cognitive impairment, and/or respiratory disorders in
     the child. Many risk factors for preterm birth have already been
     identified, including maternal age, drug use, and diabetes.
     However, such factors are exhibited in only about half of preterm
     birth mothers, highlighting a need to expand our understanding of
     what contributes to preterm birth risk.
   | Several observational studies have suggested an association between
     maternal periodontal disease and preterm birth. Periodontal disease
     is an inflammatory condition characterized by the destruction of
     tissue and/or bone around the teeth. A major component of
     periodontal disease is oral colonization by gram-negative bacteria;
     systemic release of cytokines and/or lipopolysaccharides from these
     bacteria may impact fetal condition.
   | Inoculation of the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis into pregnant
     animals does have a dose-dependent effect on birth weight and
     preterm birth signaling, but no such causal link has been shown in
     humans, only some associations. Though not definitive, the
     possibility of a significant relationship raises the question of
     whether treatment of maternal periodontal disease can decrease
     preterm birth risk.

   .. rubric:: Participants:
      :name: participants

   | 823 participants enrolled at 4 centers underwent stratified
     randomization, resulting in 413 women assigned to the treatment
     group and 410 to control. All participants were 13-16 weeks
     pregnant at time of randomization (baseline/visit 1) and went on to
     attend monthly follow-up visits defined as visits 2, 3, 4, and 5
     corresponding to gestational age ranges of 17-20, 21-24, 25-28, and
     29-32 weeks.

   .. rubric:: Treatment:
      :name: treatment

   | The treatment group received periodontal treatment, oral hygiene
     instruction, and tooth polishing at their follow-ups, while those
     assigned to control underwent only brief oral exams. Data
     collection occurred at visits 1 (baseline), 3, and 5. The primary
     outcome of interest is gestational age at end of pregnancy.
     Additional outcomes include birthweight, clinical measures of
     periodontal disease, and various microbiological and immunological
     outcomes.

   .. rubric:: Analysis:
      :name: analysis

   | Statistical analyses were carried out on an intent-to-treat basis.
     Gestational age can be thought of as 'time until end of pregnancy,'
     for which certain survival analysis methods would be appropriate.
     The study used a log-rank test stratified by center to compare time
     until end of pregnancy for treatment and control groups.
   | A semiparametric proportional hazards model was also used for this
     purpose and incorporated maternal risk factors as predictors. For
     the study's main analyses, gestational age was censored at 37 weeks
     (259 days) because the interest was in extending pregnancies that
     would otherwise end pre-term, not extending pregnancies generally.
   | Though not used in the study itself, logistic regression is another
     method that could be applied: for example, to gestational age,
     dichotomized as 'preterm' or 'not preterm' according to a
     gestational age cutoff, or to birthweight dichotomized as 'low' or
     'high' at the 2500 g or other cutoff (2500 g would be in keeping
     with the World Health Organization's definition for low birth
     weight). Changes in clinical measures of periodontal disease from
     baseline to visits 3 or 5 could be analyzed using mixed effects
     linear models. The dataset also features a number of baseline
     characteristics, which could be compared in treatment and control
     groups via Student t-tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests, Fisher's exact
     tests or Pearson's chi-square tests, as appropriate.

   | The nonsurgical periodontal treatment involving scaling and root
     planing induced significant improvements in periodontal health. The
     study did not however find a significant relation between

     study were published in 2006 by Michalowicz et al., 'Treatment of
     periodontal disease and the risk of preterm birth', in The New

      :name: details

   This represents the transplant experience in a particular region,
   over a time period in which liver transplant became much more widely
   recognized as a viable treatment modality. The number of liver
   transplants rises over the period, but the number of subjects added
   to the liver transplant waiting list grew much faster. Important
   questions addressed by the data are the change in waiting time, who
   waits, and whether there was an consequent increase in deaths while
   on the list.

   Blood type is an important consideration. Donor livers from subjects
   with blood type O can be used by patients with A, B, AB or 0 blood
   types, whereas an AB liver can only be used by an AB recipient. Thus
   type O subjects on the waiting list are at a disadvantage, since the
   pool of competitors is larger for type O donor livers.

   This data is of historical interest and provides a useful example of
   competing risks, but it has little relevance to current practice.
   Liver allocation policies have evolved and now depend directly on
   each individual patient's risk and need, assessments of which are
   regularly updated while a patient is on the waiting list. The overall
   organ shortage remains acute, however.

   The ``transplant`` data set was a version used early in the analysis,
   ``transplant2`` has several additions and corrections, and was the
   final data set and matches the paper.

   a time series chart of these deaths, in which he also recorded
   various meteorological phenomena (barometer, wind, rain), to see if
   he could find any patterns. This chart is available on the web site

   | ERCP, or endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatogram, is a
     procedure performed by threading an endoscope through the mouth to
     the opening in the duodenum where bile and pancreatic digestive
     juices are released into the intestine. ERCP is helpful for
     treating blockages of flow of bile (gallstones, cancer), or
     diagnosing cancers of the pancreas, but has a high rate of
     complications (15-25%).
   | The occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis is a common and feared
     complication, as pancreatitis can result in multisystem organ
     failure and death, and can occur in ~ 16% of ERCP procedures.
   | The inflammatory cytokine storm that can result from this
     procedural complication can be quite severe. Several small
     randomized trials suggested that anti-inflammatory NSAID therapies
     at the time of ERCP could reduce the rate of this complication, but
     all were rather small single-center studies, and were not
     sufficiently convincing to change practice.
   | Elmunzer, Higgins, and colleagues performed a
     `meta-analysis <https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18375470/>`__ of
     these small trials, which suggested that this was a significant
     effect, and that indomethacin could result in a 64% reduction in
     post-ERCP pancreatitis.
   | The investigators took this as a possible over-estimate of the
     effect (due to publication bias), and designed a multicenter RCT of
     a planned 948 patients to see a reduction of 50% from a placebo
     rate of 10% to an indomethacin rate of 5%. Two interim analyses
     were performed, after 400 and 600 patients were enrolled, using an
     alpha spending function. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board
     stopped the study after 602 participants were enrolled because of
     the significantly positive effect of indomethacin, which reduced
     post-ERCP pancreatitis from 16% in the placebo group to 9% in the

   A data frame with 555 observations on the following 7 variables.

   ``centre``
      the study center, a factor with levels ``1`` and ``2``.

   ``treatment``
      the treatment arm, a factor with levels ``placebo`` and
      ``treatment``.

   ``sex``
      a factor with levels ``female`` and ``male``.

   ``age``
      the age of the patient.

   ``status``
      the respiratory status (response variable), a factor with levels
      ``poor`` and ``good``.

   ``month``
      the month, each patient was examined at months ``0``, ``1``,
      ``2``, ``3`` and ``4``.

   ``subject``
      the patient ID, a factor with levels ``1`` to ``111``.

   .. rubric:: Details
      :name: details

   In each of two centres, eligible patients were randomly assigned to
   active treatment or placebo. During the treatment, the respiratory
   status (categorised ``poor`` or ``good``) was determined at each of
   four, monthly visits. The trial recruited 111 participants (54 in the
   active group, 57 in the placebo group) and there were no missing data
   for either the responses or the covariates. The question of interest
   is to assess whether the treatment is effective and to estimate its
   effect.

   Note that the data are in long form, i.e, repeated measurments are
   stored as additional rows in the data frame.
